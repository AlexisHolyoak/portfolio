<h2>Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of
our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data collected, and how we maintain this data under
protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.
<h2>What is GDPR?</h2>
GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data is protected by companies and
enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal data.
The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the EU-based businesses and EU residents. Our
customers' data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our
baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.
<h2>What is personal data?</h2>
Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used
on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person’s
name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP
addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.
The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:
<ul>
    <li>Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a
        person would reasonably expect.</li>
    <li>Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose.
        Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.</li>
    <li>Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</li>
    <li>People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of their data,
        and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why is GDPR important?</h2>
GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data that they collect and
process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond
these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At ANEMI AR we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we
already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.
